#1.	What is considered as Python Object?
#Everything in Python.
#2.	Name 3 data types for storing numbers? 
#int, float, complex
#3.	What is the „string“ data type? 
#Strings are sequences of character data. In Python, the string type is called 'str'. Example code:
#fact=("Sotap is a great band.")
#print(type(fact))
#Output: 
#<class 'str'>
#4. Name 3 types of containers. Built-in containers: #dict, list, set, tuple
#5. What is mutability? Name some mutable objects.
#Mutable objects can be changed post-creation, whereas immutable can't.
#Mutable objects: #list, dict, set, byte array
#Immutable objects: #int, float, complex, string, tuple, frozen set [note: immutable version of set], bytes
#6. Print the data type of "a=10" using a built-in Python function.
#a = 10
#print(type(a))
#7. Write the code to compare 2 variables (numbers) about equality.= 10
#x = 5
#y = 10
#if(x==y):
#    print(x,"is equal to",y)
#else:
#    print(x,"isn't equal to",y)
#8. Write code that prints "Hi there (n) times" for 10 times (be careful with logic errors and noun number!)
#Option 1:
#for i in range(1, 11):
#    print("Hi there",i,"times!")
#Option 2:
#for i in range(1, 11):
#    print("Hi there!")
#Option 3:
#print("Hi there 1 time!")
#for i in range(2,11,):
#    print("Hi there",i,"times!")
#9. Write code that prints "Hi" 5 times using only range function and increment by 2.
#Option 1:
#for i in range(1, 10, 2):
#    print("Hi!")
#10. Declare a list with 3 elements of different types and print the first element. 
#a=['string',42,False]
#print(a[0])
